# Pneumonia Detection using CNN

CNN-Based Pneumonia Detection: Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between bacterial and viral pneumonia.

Seamless Deployment with Ngrok: Deployed the model as a web application using Ngrok, enabling real-time pneumonia detection via a simple interface accessible remotely for healthcare providers.

Tech: TensorFlow, Keras, CNN, OpenCV, Flask, Ngrok, Python
